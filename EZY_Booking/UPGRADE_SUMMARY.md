# Android OTP SMS Forwarding App - Upgrade Summary

## Overview
Your Android SMS OTP forwarding app has been completely refactored and upgraded to address all the issues you mentioned. The app now features robust background service persistence, offline message queuing, connectivity handling, and compatibility from Android 5 (API 21) to Android 14+ (API 34).

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Background Service Persistence ✅
- **Replaced basic Service with ForegroundService** (`OTPForegroundService.java`)
- **Persistent foreground notification** prevents system from killing the service
- **START_STICKY flag** ensures service automatically restarts if killed
- **Boot receiver** (`BootReceiver.java`) restarts service after device reboot
- **Battery optimization handling** requests user to whitelist the app

### 2. Offline Message Queuing & Connectivity Handling ✅
- **Room Database** integration for local message storage
- **Automatic retry mechanism** with exponential backoff
- **Network state monitoring** automatically sends queued messages when connectivity returns
- **Message persistence** ensures no OTP is lost during network outages
- **Queue cleanup** removes old sent messages automatically

### 3. Android 11+ Compatibility ✅
- **Updated target SDK** from 30 to 34 (Android 14)
- **Updated minimum SDK** from 14 to 21 (better compatibility)
- **Added required permissions** for foreground services and network access
- **Network security config** allows HTTPS connections
- **Modern Gradle and dependencies** updated to latest stable versions

### 4. Enhanced Permissions & Security ✅
- **Foreground service permissions** properly declared
- **Battery optimization exceptions** requested from user
- **Network state access** for connectivity monitoring
- **Boot receiver** for automatic startup
- **Proper intent filters** and security configurations

## New Files Created

### Database Layer

- Uses modern Android architecture components (Room, WorkManager)
- Follows current Android security and privacy guidelines
- Updated dependencies and build tools

## Installation & Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Android Studio with latest SDK tools
2. Android SDK API 34 installed
3. Build tools 34.0.0

### Building the APK
```bash
# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK (for production)
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Signing Configuration
The release build is configured to use debug signing for testing. For production:
1. Generate a keystore: `keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`
2. Update `app/build.gradle` with your keystore details
3. Remove `signingConfig signingConfigs.debug` from release build type

### Testing the Updates
1. Install the new APK
2. Grant all permissions when prompted
3. Configure email and mobile numbers
4. Allow battery optimization exception when prompted
5. Verify the foreground service notification appears
6. Test offline message queuing by disabling/enabling network

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"App not installed" error**: Uninstall old version first, clear package installer cache
2. **Service not starting**: Check if battery optimization is disabled for the app
3. **Messages not sending**: Verify network permissions and connectivity
4. **Background service killed**: Ensure battery optimization is disabled

### Debugging
- Check Logcat for detailed logs with tag "OTPForegroundService"
- Monitor database using Device File Explorer in Android Studio
- Verify permissions in App Settings
